"""Belief management -- auditable agent priors for HIVE.

Agents write "belief" cells to explicitly state what they assume is true
before acting. A Critic agent can inspect these beliefs, identify wrong ones,
and emit corrections. This enables surgical repair instead of blind retries.

Example workflow:
    1. Agent writes a belief: "I believe error 1102 is caused by sequential requests"
    2. Agent acts on that belief
    3. If it fails, the Critic finds the belief cell and marks it as "refuted"
    4. The evolution module detects refuted beliefs and emits improvement signals
